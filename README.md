In order to use the registration and login pages you will need to create a MySQL database named 'register'.  Then create a table named 'users'.  You will then need to create five columns named 'id','username','email',password' and 'trn_date'
You will also need to launch Xampp and start Apache and MySQL.  Save the unzipped folder in the htdocs folder in Xampp.  Then type the URL "localhost/E-Sports-Betting_Application-master/SoftwareProject/login.php" into the address bar and you are good to go.
